They set off to explore the Wasteland, where mutants are already lying in wait. The player will be able to visit 6 regions, each of which has its own types of dangerous animals and landscape. Among the scorched desert there are also wooded areas with red trees. What is most surprising is that quite recently the desert territories were inhabited by those who were able to survive the apocalypse on the surface.</p>
