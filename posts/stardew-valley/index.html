<p><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> is a sandbox simulator with pixel graphics and multi-platform support, but with a well-thought-out system for earning money and maintaining game balance for the player. The beginning of the game shows how our hero first comes to an abandoned farm, which he received from a deceased relative. Since the protagonist does not mind making money by planting and selling vegetables and fruits, he decides not to sell the farm, but to start equipping it. There is a small house on the territory in which we will store things.</p>
<p>We will be able to buy livestock and get food from it. For example, if we built a pen for pigs, we can always eat pork or send some of the meat to a neighboring city, at the same time taking on the next task. In the province, power was seized by one person who the residents did not like too much, so they ask us to return the old ruler, or to help establish their usual mode of life.</p>
<p>The gameplay of the game is not limited to simply planting plants or buying animals. We can go further. If there is a river near the house, then our activities will include fishing, but that’s not all. The main currency in the game is money. We earn them if we sell valuable ore from the mines or complete tasks in the same mines. Inside them we can find not only resources, but also valuable items, such as weapons, some furniture, or items for a task.
