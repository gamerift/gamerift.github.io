<p><strong>GTA 5</strong> has received dozens of awards for its open world, and almost the most expensive multi-platform project in history is <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>. The story opens before us in the same fictional state - San Andreas, made 1 to 1 as Southern California. We play as three robber friends who have spent their entire adult lives stealing cars, robbing small shops and people on the street. One day someone decides to get involved in organized crime, which they have been fighting for the last 5 years. The plot picture is revealed in three characters at once. The story comes from them. We don’t see a special scenario before the meeting of all three repeat offenders, but after the meeting, real chaos opens up.
