Forget about the conquest of the new worlds - here the survival depends on how to cling to the fragment of the rock among the inexorable stream of mucus. You play for the captain, the last hope of mankind, who is instructed to establish a fragile colony on a hostile foreign world. Your enemies are not rival empires and not robots with lasers, but the ubiquitous mucus, a reasonable, changing form, the threat that oozes, drips and crawls to your colony from all sides.</p>
