Often, they relate either to the units produced there, or to the buildings themselves. For example, in the city center you can open loopholes, which will allow settlers settled there during a period of alarm to fire at the enemy, and you can also research handcarts to speed up the collection of resources and increase the health of workers.\nCombat units are represented by infantry, riflemen, cavalry, siege engines and special units.

All nations are balanced and each has both disadvantages and advantages. In addition, all unit lines are voiced in the language of the nation you are playing for. The game supports both a regular battle mode, where you choose your opponents, their number and strength, and a multiplayer mode. And for lovers of historical battles, there is a campaign mode in which you can follow the vivid battles of great commanders such as Joan of Arc, Attila, Genghis Khan, Richard the Lionheart, William Wallace and so on.\nGame Screenshots        Game Videos  ","wordCount":"516","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gamerift.github.io/posts/age-of-empires-2/images/age-of-empires-2.jpg","datePublished":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2013-04-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Seiri"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamerift.github.io/posts/age-of-empires-2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Rift","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamerift.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
