The characterâ€™s castle was also virtually destroyed during the period of his sleep, so it must be gradually restored, as well as getting new servants among the people in order to raise the Empire. The user here is asked to act in the Gothic world, exploring its vast expanses where mythical creatures live, human settlements, impenetrable forests, dark dungeons in which valuable resources can be obtained. During the journey, the protagonist also meets different characters - allies and opponents with whom he has to fight, plunder villages together, and raid opponents.\nThe main rule of a vampire is to always be in the shadows so that the sun does not turn him into ashes, so it is worth hunting and acting at night. As he progresses, the vampire hero collects resources and interacts with various ancient techniques, which allows him to enlist the support of the Dark Forces, and also uses the acquired knowledge to rebuild his house, in which not only loot is stored, but also his army arrives. You can move alone or team up with vampire friends, which gives great advantages, for example, when fighting with a more powerful enemy. Here you will also have to learn how to use an arsenal of all kinds of weapons and different abilities, which ultimately allows you to successfully aim, dodge enemy bullets and combine melee and ranged weapons along with skills.
