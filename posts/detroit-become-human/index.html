<p><strong>Detroit: Become Human</strong> is a rather interesting game in the interactive cinema genre. It is based on the Quantic Dream graphics core, so the excellent graphics component immediately catches your eye. It is impossible not to note the titanic work of the animators, who created truly gorgeous animations and scenes that were plausible from the point of view of anatomy and physics.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the future, in an era of highly developed technology, where androids have already firmly taken their place next to people as loyal and multifunctional humanoid servants. The game&rsquo;s plot tells the stories of three androids. Kara escapes her owner, slowly gains self-awareness, and protects the little girl. Connor is a hunter of fugitive androids. And Marcus is a fugitive who has chosen the goal of his life to save the rest of the androids from slavery.</p>
<p>Gameplay is a third-person adventure game with a choice of perspective. Various game characters can die during the story and events continue without them, so after death there will no longer be a Game Over sign, but the flow of the plot and the possible ending also change.</p>

<p>Depending on the player’s choice, the course of the plot changes, new conditions arise and other possibilities are cut off, so the game has enormous variability and replayability.
